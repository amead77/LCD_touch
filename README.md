# LCD_touch

vscode uploaded my whole lcd test directory...

really there is only 3 files that matter:


  lcdserial_keyboard.py on the PC side (linux)
  
  m_serialstuff.py on the PC side (this came from the pyserial library examples to look up available ports and was modified by me)
  
  lcd/lcd.ino on the Arduino Uno side (has to be in sub dir because aruino ide)
  

most of the other files are libs that came with the LCD: 
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075CXXL1M


They were dumped in the directory purely to stop VSCode complaining about missing files (still does)


Other than that there are a couple of test files
